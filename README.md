# Code Challenge

## Demo Project

We need you to create an app that allows our users from a social network to see posts and comments.

The app consists of two screens: a list of posts and the post details.

### Posts Screen

 - A post has a title.
 - When a post is tapped, the user should be redirected to the detail screen. 
 - The user should be able to refresh the content.

### Post Detail

For the post detail, we expect to see its author, description, number of comments, and the comments.

### API

Here is the [API docs](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com), you should use the following endpoints:

 - `/posts`
 - `/comments`
 - `/users`

We expect you to use the `GET` method only.

### Requirements

- Support iOS 13+
- Use Swift 5.4 or above
- It should compile and run.
- Have some sort of persistence/cache mechanism.
- Provide a `COMMENTS.md` file mentioned in [Notes](#notes).
